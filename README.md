# Phone-Number-Authenticator
A simple Django-based Phone Number Authenticator developed during my early learning days with Django. This project allows users to verify their phone numbers via Password authentication, ensuring secure user registration and login processes. It served as a foundational experience in working with Django forms, models, and views.
